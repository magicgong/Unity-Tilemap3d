# Unity-Tilemap3d
A generic and game-agnostic implementation of a 3D tilemap in Unity.

The tilemap is built using a mesh and can be used for both 2D and 3D games.

The vertices are shared (not split) and allows blending. 

This project is meant to be an example or starting point and has not been optimized. 

Enjoy!
